                1: "**Exercise 1: The Zero Vector - Explanation**\n\n**Problem**: Prove that if v⃗ · v⃗ = 0, then v⃗ must be the zero vector.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**:\n\n1. **Start with the given relationship**: We know that v⃗ · v⃗ = ||v⃗||²\n\n2. **Apply the given condition**: If v⃗ · v⃗ = 0, then ||v⃗||² = 0\n\n3. **Use properties of magnitude**: Since ||v⃗||² represents the square of the magnitude, and we know that the square of any real number is non-negative, ||v⃗||² ≥ 0\n\n4. **The only solution**: The only way ||v⃗||² = 0 is if ||v⃗|| = 0\n\n5. **Conclude**: A vector has magnitude 0 if and only if it is the zero vector v⃗ = [0, 0, ..., 0]\n\n**Geometric Intuition**: The dot product of a vector with itself gives you the square of its length. If this is zero, the vector has no length, meaning it's the zero vector - a point with no direction or magnitude.",

                2: "**Exercise 2: Orthogonality - Explanation**\n\n**Problem**: Find a non-zero vector b⃗ orthogonal to a⃗ = [2, 5].\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**:\n\n1. **Orthogonality condition**: Two vectors are orthogonal when their dot product equals zero: a⃗ · b⃗ = 0\n\n2. **Set up the equation**: Let b⃗ = [x, y]. Then: [2, 5] · [x, y] = 2x + 5y = 0\n\n3. **Solve for the relationship**: 2x + 5y = 0, so x = -5y/2\n\n4. **Choose a value**: Let y = 2, then x = -5. So b⃗ = [-5, 2]\n\n5. **Verify**: [2, 5] · [-5, 2] = 2(-5) + 5(2) = -10 + 10 = 0 ✓\n\n**Are there other solutions?** Yes! Any scalar multiple of [-5, 2] will also be orthogonal to a⃗. The set of all orthogonal vectors forms a line through the origin.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**: In 2D, the orthogonal vectors to a⃗ form a line perpendicular to a⃗. This represents all possible directions that are 90° from the original vector.",

                3: "**Exercise 3: Recommendation System - Explanation**\n\n**Problem**: User preference u⃗ = [5, 1], Movie A = [4, 0], Movie B = [3, 3]. Which to recommend?\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**:\n\n1. **Calculate dot products**:\n   - u⃗ · Movie A = [5, 1] · [4, 0] = 5(4) + 1(0) = 20\n   - u⃗ · Movie B = [5, 1] · [3, 3] = 5(3) + 1(3) = 18\n\n2. **Compare the values**: 20 > 18, so Movie A has higher similarity\n\n3. **Recommendation**: Recommend Movie A\n\n**What the numbers mean**:\n- The dot product measures \"alignment\" between preferences and movie characteristics\n- Higher dot product = better match\n- Movie A (pure action, no comedy) aligns well with user's strong action preference (5) and weak comedy preference (1)\n- Movie B (balanced action/comedy) doesn't match the user's strong action bias as well\n\n**Real-world insight**: This is the foundation of collaborative filtering in recommendation systems. The dot product captures how well a user's preference profile matches an item's feature profile.",

                4: "**Exercise 4: Vector Projections - Explanation**\n\n**Problem**: Project a⃗ = [2, 3] onto b⃗ = [4, 0]. What does this represent?\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**:\n\n1. **Apply the projection formula**: proj_b⃗(a⃗) = (a⃗ · b⃗/||b⃗||²) × b⃗\n\n2. **Calculate the dot product**: a⃗ · b⃗ = [2, 3] · [4, 0] = 2(4) + 3(0) = 8\n\n3. **Calculate ||b⃗||²**: ||b⃗||² = 4² + 0² = 16\n\n4. **Compute the scalar**: (a⃗ · b⃗/||b⃗||²) = 8/16 = 1/2\n\n5. **Find the projection**: proj_b⃗(a⃗) = (1/2) × [4, 0] = [2, 0]\n\n**Geometric Interpretation**:\n- The projection [2, 0] is the \"shadow\" that a⃗ casts onto the direction of b⃗\n- It's the component of a⃗ that points in the same direction as b⃗\n- The length 2 tells us how much of a⃗ goes in the b⃗ direction\n\n**Practical Applications**: Projections are used in computer graphics for lighting calculations, in machine learning for dimensionality reduction, and in physics for decomposing forces into components."
